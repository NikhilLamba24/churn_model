# churn_model


This is the dataset of a bank, which is seeing an unusual churn of customers(customers leaving their bank).

So, based on the customer's credit score, present balance, etc. We will predict that which customer is going to leave the bank and which one will not based on the patterns of their activity in their bank account(like active transactions or not, etc.) .
